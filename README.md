# KIN Algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors) with External CSV

This repository demonstrates the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using an external CSV file as the dataset. The example shows a simple fruit classification problem: determining whether a new fruit is an "Apple" or an "Orange" based on its weight and texture.

## Overview

The KNN algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method used for both classification and regression. It works by finding the *k* nearest neighbors of a new data point using a distance metric (here, Euclidean distance) and using those neighbors to make a prediction via a majority vote.

### Key Concepts

- **Dataset:** Stored in `data.csv`, containing fruit data with columns: `weight`, `texture_score`, and `label`.
- **Distance Metric:** Euclidean distance is used to measure similarity between feature vectors.
- **Classification:** The new data point is classified based on the most frequent label among the k nearest neighbors.
- **No Training Phase:** The algorithm simply reads data from the CSV file and calculates distances on the fly.

## Files in the Repository

- **`data.csv`**: Contains the sample dataset.
- **`kin_algorithm.py`**: Python script to perform KNN classification using data from the CSV file.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists any Python dependencies (none are required beyond the standard library for this example).
